# Excellent-Privacy-and-Security-Information
A collection of blogs, podcasts, videos, etc. that I would recommend related to pentesting, hacking, CTF, reverse engineering, privacy, OSINT, programming, and the works.

## Blogs

* [yakuhito's blog](https://kuhi.to/): CTF writeups, programming.
* [ropnop blog](https://blog.ropnop.com/): pentesting, with some interesting posts about docker, kubernetes, etc.

## Podcasts

* [The Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show](https://www.inteltechniques.com/podcast.html): great information about personal privacy, and a host who is not an asshole about it. 
* [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/): probably my favorite podcast. This one is moreso entertainment, but still very informative. Some of the stories will blow you away.
  * My favorite episode (it's a two part episode): [Xbox Underground](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/45/)
* [Security Now!](https://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm): up to date news on what is happening in security. Informative and interesting.
* [Malicious Life Podcast](https://malicious.life/): similar to Darknet Diaries in the types of events they cover. Also very interesting and informative!

## Miscellaneous articles

These articles may be one off's from a particular site, or just anything else I find to be interesting. This section may very well become a shitshow and need to be moved to its own file.
